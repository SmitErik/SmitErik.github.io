			<p>Hi! I'm Erik Smit from Serbia, Vojvodina. Or you can call me $mitE for short. Yes, my nickname really
			came from my real name. Wow! So creative, I know! Whatever. Creativity is my middle name. As you can see in
			the	names of my games.</p>

			<p>I'm currently <span id="age"></span> years old. I'm a graduate student in the Faculty of Science and
			Informatics at the University of Szeged.</p>

			<p>My hobby of making games started when I was 15. My elementary school computer science teacher introduced
			me to this world. The first 6-7 games were created in that spring and summer. After that, in high school I
			made one more game about shooting my classmates. They really enjoyed it. Except the teacher... But moving
			on, I made my first ever 'big' game called 'The Dark Library'. I was pretty proud of myself. I also went to
			a competition with it. I saw many other games in the competition, some of which were made in Unity. I liked
			the game engine right away. So I started turning to Unity and to the 3D games.</p>

			<p>First I became friends with the engine and the whole 3D stuff. I made my first 3D game called 'HalloBab'
			(bab means bean in hungarian). Just a silly random name. The main character looked like a bean - hence the
			name. It wasn't anything special. It isn't even finished. I put it here on my website, because why not?
			Here's my second game too, called 'Game'. I said, that I'm such a creative guy. But after these little
			clumsiness, I started creating my masterpiece.</p>

			<p>'Logic'. It is the work of my life. I am proud to say that I made this game. From the beginning to the
			end. Although I had quite a hard and long time making this game. I started making it at the beginning of
			high school, and in April 2023 I was finally able to say that it was finished. After all, I managed to
			finish 'Logic' as the subject of my thesis.</p>

			<p>In the spring of 2023, I had a course called multimedia, where the task was to make a copy of an
			existing game. I was given the game called 'Bejeweled' to make using jQuery. Finally, I got permission from
			my teachers to share this game on my website at the end of the semester, when all the project work was
			graded.</p>

			<p>Here are some of my contact details if you want to get in touch with me:</p>
