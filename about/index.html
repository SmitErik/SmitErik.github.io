		<article>
			<p>Hi! I'm Erik Smit from Serbia, Vojvodina. Or you can call me $mitE for short. Yes, my nickname really
			came from my real name. Wow! So creative, I know! Whatever. Creativity is my middle name. As you can see in
			the	names of my games.</p>

			<p>I'm currently <span id="age"></span> years old. I obtained my Master's Degree in Computer Science in July
			2025 from the Faculty of Science and Informatics at the University of Szeged. I am currently actively
			seeking employment.</p>

			<p>My hobby of making games started when I was 15. My elementary school computer science teacher introduced
			me to this world. The first 6-7 games were created in that spring and summer. After that, in high school I
			made one more game about shooting my classmates. They really enjoyed it. Except the teacher... But moving
			on, I made my first ever 'big' game called '<a href="../tdl">The Dark Library</a>'. I was pretty proud of
			myself. I also went to a competition with it. I saw many other games in the competition, some of which were
			made in Unity. I liked the game engine right away. So I started turning to Unity and to the 3D games.</p>

			<p>First I became friends with the engine and the whole 3D stuff. I made my first 3D game called
			'<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12nCw-nBGBBPJdRphvnZDtmCritsfiYdK?usp=sharing">HalloBab</a>'
			(bab means bean in hungarian). Just a silly random name. The main character looked like a bean - hence the
			name. It wasn't anything special. It isn't even finished. I put it here on my website, because why not?
			Here's my second game too, called
			'<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nHokUbaP0wSopFVsGRRcT9wPF_e6YwUs?usp=sharing">Game</a>'.
			I said, that I'm such a creative guy. But after these little clumsiness, I started creating my
			masterpiece.</p>

			<p>'<a href="../logic">Logic</a>'. It is the work of my life. I am proud to say that I made this game. From
			the beginning to the end. Although I had quite a hard and long time making this game. I started making it at
			the beginning of high school, and in April 2023 I was finally able to say that it was finished. After all, I
			managed to finish '<a href="../logic">Logic</a>' as the subject of my Bachelor's thesis.</p>

			<p>In the spring of 2023, I had a course called multimedia, where the task was to make a copy of an
			existing game. I was given the game called '<a href="../bejeweled">Bejeweled</a>' to make using jQuery.
			Finally, I got permission from my teachers to share this game on my website at the end of the semester, when
			all the project work was graded.</p>

			<p>The game '<a href="https://wildwars.web.app">Wild Wars</a>' was inspired by the original Gwent minigame
			from The Witcher III. I had long wanted to create my own card game, and in 2025, as part of my Master's
			thesis, this finally became a reality.</p>
